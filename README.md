# ðŸ¤– Recommendify.AI â€” AI-Powered YouTube Product Review Analyzer

Tired of watching 10 different YouTube reviews before buying one product?

Recommendify.ai is an AI-based product review assistant that saves you time and helps you make smarter buying decisions.  
Just enter a product name, and our system:

âœ… Searches for the top YouTube video reviews  
âœ… Filters out irrelevant videos and content  
âœ… Extracts pros and cons from transcripts  
âœ… Aggregates the insights  
âœ… Gives you a final verdict (Recommended / Not Recommended)

## How It Works (Multi-Agent Pipeline)

This project uses a LangGraph-powered multi-agent workflow to simulate the decision-making of an AI assistant.

### Agents Involved:

### 1. Product Specificity Checker  
   - Ensures the product query is specific (e.g., "Samsung Galaxy S25" instead of just "Samsung")

### 2. YouTube Search Agent  
   - Fetches top 10 YouTube video IDs using youtube-search-python API

### 3. YouTube Transcript Agent  
   - Extracts the transcript of videos using the YouTubeTranscriptAPI

### 4. Relevance Filter  
   - Uses an LLM (Groq) to filter out unrelated and irrelevant videos

### 5. Transcript Summarizer  
   - Extracts pros & cons from each transcript using LLM prompting

### 6. Verdict Aggregator  
   - Aggregates pros/cons across all videos and generates a final recommendation along with reasoning
